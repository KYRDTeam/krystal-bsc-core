# Introduction

[![built-with openzeppelin](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-OpenZeppelin-3677FF)](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/)

Smart Contracts for Krystal to help interact with protocols on Binance Smart Chain;

## Package Manager

We use `yarn` as the package manager. You may use `npm` and `npx` instead, but commands in bash scripts may have to be changed accordingly.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn install`

## Compilation

`yarn compile` to compile contracts for all solidity versions.

## Contract Deployment / Interactions

For interactions or contract deployments on public testnets / mainnet, create a `.env` file specifying your private key and infura api key, with the following format:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x****************************************************************
```

## Testing

1. If contracts have not been compiled, run `yarn compile` or `yarn c`. This step can be skipped subsequently.
2. Run `yarn test -h` for instruction

```bash
yarn <deploy,test> [-h] [-c <eth,bsc,polygon>] [-n <mainnet,testnet,ropsten>] -- to run test on specific chain and network

where:
    -h  show this help text
    -c  which chain to run, supported <eth,bsc,polygon>
    -n  which network to run, supported <mainnet,testnet,ropsten,mumbai>
    -f  specific test to run if any
```

## Deploying

1. Run `yarn deploy -h` for instruction

```bash
yarn <deploy,test> [-h] [-c <eth,bsc,polygon>] [-n <mainnet,testnet,ropsten>] -- to run test on specific chain and network

where:
    -h  show this help text
    -c  which chain to run, supported <eth,bsc,polygon>
    -n  which network to run, supported <mainnet,testnet,ropsten,mumbai>
    -f  specific test to run if any
```

### Example Commands

- `yarn test` (Runs all tests)
- `yarn test -f ./test/swap.test.ts` (Test only swap.test.ts)

## Coverage

- Run `yarn coverage` for coverage on files
